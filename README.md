This is the assignment 4 of the web5201 course.
The tutorial given on the opentech website for the setup of the initial
CRUD functionality of the website which in that case was an article editor.

My additions

I added a new feature, which is a calendar which is displayed upon clicking the view calendar button.
I implemented this after some research, it is part of a javascript library called fullcalendar.

Additionally, I added a feature of the calendar which is the new events page that 
takes text as an input and displays it to the user. 

I followed the same principles that were shown in the
tutorial which implied the proper implementation and use of controllers and routing to be able to produce 
working views.

Testing
The calendar does render with no bugs and is clickable while being functional.

The new events button works and it brings the user to the new events page where he is
subjected to filling a form.Upon filling it, the text was supposed to be shown to the user, similar
to the articles CRUD app, unfortunately its not showing up the text and I cannot seem to be able to solve the issue.

Additionally, My css seems to not work either for some unknown reasons.
